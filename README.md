//WORK IN PROGRESS//
Game of Noughts & Crosses built with HTML/CSS/JS

Doing this I learned: 
- How to set up basic modules in JS
- How to access attributes using .dataset.[attribute name]
- Using event listeners for pageload


Still to do:
- Prevent player/computer collisions
- Add restart game 
- Better AI!
